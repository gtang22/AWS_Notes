# 2/8/25 Notes

AWS is a cloud service created by Amazon. A cloud service is when a third-party company allows someone to rent/borrow their services/applications and get charged 
a rate. Their services are usually easily accesible and scalable. The user usually only pays what they have to. 

When you ask for a machine, you usually give them parameters (aka, how much storage, how fast, etc...) and they won't like get/make a machine just for you. 
What they do, is give you a virtual machine, which has your desired parameters instead. A virtual machine is software that mimics are computer with its own OS. 

Why use a virtual machine? Well, what if I want to run Microsoft software on a Mac?

It doesn't because the OS don't match, and I don't want to erase my Mac stuff to replace it with Microsoft.

Steps:
- Download VMware (Many types)
- Tell them which software you want
- Download it, so now the software is in the computer (it's saved) (This is the VM)
- To use, you have to launch it every time
- Now you can use it

You can run many machine on the same physcial machine. It's only limited by the physical machine itself. 

The VMs can even communicate with each other on the same machine (cause they both act like two computers).

So back, to the cloud service. The company builds a virtual machine and it can used on any physical machine. They usually have them built, so they just tune the 
details and they send it out.
